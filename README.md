# OpenFaaS CLI - Headstart

faas-cli is at https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli is the official CLI for OpenFaaS

Use in conjunction with OpenFaas, see https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/openfaas-headstart

The CLI can be used to build and deploy functions to OpenFaaS. You can build OpenFaaS functions from a set of supported language templates (such as Node.js, Python, CSharp and Ruby). That means you just write a handler file such as (handler.py/handler.js) and the CLI does the rest to create a Docker image.
